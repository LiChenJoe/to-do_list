# to-do_list
My second JS project. 
The project is mainly created to practice DOM and local storage. I was following along the project from a Udemy course  "2021網頁開發全攻略", and at some point, I decided to challenge myself to make it more functional. The original project, which lecturer Wilson Ren created, focused on date sorting and local storage. This project ended up can be sorted by priority, finish status and date (including time). 
The other feature for this project is the introduction and the feedback. When you open up the to-do list for the first time, you will see the guild of the project as a welcome page, and when you finish up all the tasks on your list, don't be too surprised to see the positive feedback you deserve. 

p.s For all mandarin speakers, I strongly recommend you the Udemy course  "2021網頁開發全攻略", lecturer Wilson Ren is a brilliant creator and content provider. His class is easy to follow and very informative.  For a price less than $10, you will get more than 60 hours of solid knowledge from frontend to backend, up to date information and most importantly, question response within 24 hours.
